# Deep Learning Courses
### Course 1: Keras with TensorFlow Course - Python Deep Learning and Neural Networks for Beginners Tutorial.
In this course, I learned how to use Keras, a neural network API written in Python and integrated with TensorFlow. In addition, how to prepare and process data for artificial neural networks, build and train artificial neural networks from scratch, build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), implement fine-tuning and transfer learning, and more!
